          Based on your available ingredients, I would recommend making a
          <strong> Creamy Garlic Parmesan Chicken </strong> dish. Here's the
          recipe:
        </p>

        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
          <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
          <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
          <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
          <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
          <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
          <li>1 cup fresh spinach (optional)</li>
          <li>1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes (optional)</li>
          <li>Fresh parsley for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Instructions:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Season the Chicken:</strong> Season the chicken breasts with
            salt and pepper on both sides.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong> In a large skillet, heat the
            olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook
            for 5-7 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked
            through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sauté Garlic:</strong> In the same skillet, reduce the heat
            to medium. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until
            fragrant.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Make the Sauce:</strong> Add the heavy cream, chicken broth,
            and Italian seasoning to the skillet. Stir to combine and bring the
            mixture to a simmer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add Parmesan:</strong> Stir in the Parmesan cheese and let
            it melt into the sauce. Continue to simmer for about 2–3 minutes
            until the sauce thickens slightly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Optional Add-ins:</strong> If using, add the fresh spinach
            and sun-dried tomatoes to the sauce. Cook for an additional 2–3
            minutes until the spinach is wilted.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Combine with Chicken:</strong> Return the chicken breasts to
            the skillet, spooning the sauce over them. Let everything simmer
            together for a couple of minutes until the chicken is heated
            through.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Serve:</strong> Garnish with fresh parsley and serve the
            chicken with the creamy garlic Parmesan sauce over pasta, rice, or
            mashed potatoes.
          </li>
        </ol>
